In this code I use many image processing and image segmentation techniques along with RCNN to detect license plats and read its number in any image using Matlab. 

What is nice about this code is that it is fast and it implements multilevel segmentation, machine learning and OCR all together in one code to get most accurate results for images with much variety in zoom, size or resolution.

The code is commented in details at each line to know the idea and algorithm used in it.
